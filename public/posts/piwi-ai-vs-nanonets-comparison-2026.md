## What Makes Piwi.ai Different

**Finished documents, not data dumps.** Most extraction tools, Nanonets included, hand you text and ask "what now?" Piwi.ai answers that question. Upload a passport and a deed, select your contract template, and download a completed PDF. What used to take 20 minutes of manual typing takes under 2.

**Intelligent Mapping.** This is the engine behind Piwi.ai. Instead of just reading characters, it understands that a Passport Number and an ID Number are different data points even when they look identical on the page. It maps each extracted field directly into the correct position in your template, maintaining exact font, size, and formatting.

**Cross-reference validation.** Before any contract gets generated, Piwi.ai checks data consistency across all your source documents. If the legal name on a passport doesn't match the account holder on a utility bill, the system flags it. One caught mismatch on a property deal can save thousands in legal disputes.

**No technical skills required.** No ML models to train. No API integrations to build. No developer needed. Upload your documents, pick a template, get a result. It's built for real estate agents, legal assistants, and finance teams who need to move fast.

**98% accuracy on complex documents.** Not on clean, standard invoices. On the hard stuff: identity documents from multiple countries, property deeds with nested legal descriptions, multi-page contracts with variable layouts.

## Pricing That Fits Your Business

At Piwi.ai, we offer a flexible pricing strategy tailored to your requirements. Choose from a **Starter** plan at €0.20/page for small volumes and pilot programs, a **Business** plan with volume discounts that scale as you grow (down to €0.05/page for 30,000+ pages), or an **Enterprise** plan with custom pricing and dedicated support. Unlike Nanonets' pricing model of 30 cents per page, our value-driven approach ensures you only pay for what you use, and your cost per page decreases as your volume increases. Both Starter and Business plans include a free 14-day trial.

## The Bottom Line

Small businesses don't get paid for extracted data. They get paid for signed contracts, filed forms, and completed applications. Piwi.ai handles the full loop: from source document to finished output, validated, formatted, and ready to go.

## FAQs

**Q: Can I switch from Nanonets to Piwi.ai easily?**
Yes. Piwi.ai requires no model training and no migration of workflows. You start fresh by uploading your document templates and processing immediately.

**Q: Does Piwi.ai work with documents outside of real estate and legal?**
Yes. Any workflow that involves extracting data from source documents and placing it into a template works with Piwi.ai: insurance claims, HR onboarding forms, loan applications, compliance filings.

**Q: What if I only need data extraction, not finished documents?**
Piwi.ai does both. You can extract structured data without generating a document. But if you ever need completed output, the capability is built in.

**Q: How fast is the setup?**
Minutes. There's no model training phase. Upload your template, upload your source documents, and Piwi.ai handles the rest.
